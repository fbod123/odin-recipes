    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1–2 tablespoons ground coffee (adjust to your taste)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Sugar (optional, to taste)</li>
        <li>Milk or cream (optional)</li>
        <li>Optional: Cinnamon, cocoa powder, or vanilla extract for extra flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 cup of water in a kettle until it reaches a boil. 
            If you're using a French press or pour-over method, make sure to let the water cool slightly after boiling (about 30 seconds) before pouring over the coffee grounds.
        </li>
        <li>Measure out 1–2 tablespoons of ground coffee (depending on how strong you like your coffee). Adjust to your preference.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If using a coffee maker, simply add the grounds to the filter.</li>
            <li>For a French press, add the coffee directly to the press.</li>
            <li>If using a pour-over, place a filter in the dripper and add the coffee grounds.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Brew the Coffee</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drip coffee maker: Start the brewing process by turning it on.</li>
            <li>French press: Pour the hot water over the coffee grounds, stir gently, and place the lid on.
                 Let it steep for about 4 minutes, then press the plunger slowly to separate the grounds from the coffee.
            </li>
            <li>Pour-over: Slowly pour the hot water in a circular motion over the coffee grounds, allowing the water to filter through. Keep pouring until you have 1 cup of brewed coffee.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Add sugar, milk, or cream to taste.</li>
        <li>For extra flavor, sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon, cocoa powder, or a drop of vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Stir well and serve hot! Enjoy your perfect cup of classic coffee.</li>
